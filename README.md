He shows much interest in sciences and arrives there with great enthusiasm, while the rest students of his class are dull and uninterested. During the tour, a spider, which has been genetically engineered, escapes from its aquarium, and happens accidentally to bite Peter on the hand. At first Peter does not feel any change, but when he arrives home he faints in his room.

In the morning when Peter wakes up, the first thing that astonishes him is the fact that he is no longer near-sighted. All his life he was wearing glasses, and now he sees perfectly without them. The next thing, which astonishes him even more, is his physique. When he looks in the mirror he finds that he is in splendid muscular fit. But along with these pleasant changes, there are ones which bring him some troubles. During the lunch in the school Peter accidentally finds that his wrists are producing webs, and he happens accidentally to throw a tray with food into Flash Thompson, one of the strongest and fiercest bullies in the school. Flash is not going to let such an insult remain and steps into the confrontation with Peter. During the fight Peter learns of other super powers, which he now possesses.
